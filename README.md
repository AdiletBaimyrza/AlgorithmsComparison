It is a project done for the course of Algorithms and Complexity.
The purpose of the project was to implement 4 known algorithms
(insertion, heap, merge, and quick sorting algorithms) by hand
without using any internet resources. The 4 algorithms were implemented,
compared in terms of speed of sorting. The conclusions are provided in
paper.pdf file with graphs included.
